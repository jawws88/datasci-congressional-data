# Running The Webapp

## Webapp structure

The Django project resides in the [django/congressionaldata](../django/congressionaldata) folder of the repository.  It contains two Django apps:

* [api](../django/congressionaldata/api) is a JSON API server, which has mappings for the database tables in [models.py](../django/congressionaldata/api/models.py) and uses the Django Rest Framework to power the API (see [views.py](../django/congressionaldata/api/views.py) and [serializers.py](../django/congressionaldata/api/serializers.py)).
* [webapp](../django/congressionaldata/webapp) is a static webapp that pulls data from the API server and renders a visualization.  It doesn't have any backend models, just a simple [view](../django/congressionaldata/webapp/views.py) and [HTML page](../django/congressionaldata/webapp/templates/webapp/index.html) and soon there'll be a lot af JavaScript.

## Tutorials

### Django

If you'd like a refresher on Django, there's a good tutorial here:

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/

A few notes:
* For our app, we're not building models.py and running migration like the tutorial describes, because the data science team has set up the database with tables already created.  Instead, we produce a `models.py` that is reverse-engineered from the database schema using `python manage.py inspectdb`
* The tutorial goes into some depth on the templating language and views.  These are useful for traditional webapps.  Our visualization is probably going to be a [Single Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) or SPA, which generally has simple, static HTML, but more complicated JavaScript that reads data from the API server and renders the page.

### Django REST Framework

Here's a tutorial on the Django REST Framework:

http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/

A few notes:
* This tutorial takes a somewhat longwinded approach by going through a bunch of lower-level views, before getting to the more concise `ViewSet`s and `Router`s that everyone ends up using in practice. So don't be discouraged if the first part of the tutorial doesn't seem to match anything you see in the repository.

## Running the webapp locally

1. Make sure your anaconda environment is activated, as described [here](02_developmen_environment.md#testing-python-installation)
2. Run the `export CD_DWH` command described [here](02_development_environment.md#verifying-your-development-environment)
3. From the `django/congressionaldata` folder, run `python manage.py runserver`
4. You should see output like this if everything went well:
```
Performing system checks...

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).

You have 14 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

5. Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in your browser to view the webapp.
6. You can also explore the API responses at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/models/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/models/).
